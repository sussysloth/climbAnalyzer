use tensorflow MoveNet Lightning to determine the pose from a video

use angles and trig to see if it's good climbing technique

goal is to make this a vercel app, connect the python to the nextjs with flask

or then make like a pose classification thingy where you dont have to explicitely say the angles to determine good technique
like the ai can be trained on what poses r good technique or not
